A partial solution manual for: The Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome Friedman, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani

This work is expected to be used as a supplementary material for Weatherwax and Epstein's solution manual, which I found to be very helpful when self-studying this popular textbook. The numbering of chapters and problems are based on the 2nd edition of this book (10th printing with corrections, Jan 2013) available online.

We expect many mistakes and shortcomings in this solution manual. It would be of great help if people could help us find and correct them so this work can be continuously improved to benefit more interested readers. We are also open to all comments, suggestions and criticisms.
